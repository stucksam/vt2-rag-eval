Additionally, the Wood Elf subrace's reclusive lives in Faerun's forests and their decades of training in archery and camouflage are further enhanced by an otherworldly swiftness. This swiftness, which is likely a result of their Fey ancestry, allows them to move quickly and silently through the forest, making it easier for them to find advantageous positions for archery or to blend seamlessly into their surroundings for camouflage.

And since I have low wisdom as a ranger, I don't really have good wisdom, I want to stick to spells that don't work off of my wisdom modifier.   What I'm going to take here is Longstrider, increase the creature's movement speed by 10 feet, which lasts until a long rest.   And that kind of, you know it kind of messes with your ability to pass Hunter's Mark around as both require a bonus action, so I'm going to take longstrider, accompany longstrider with my what elf plus five movement speed.
