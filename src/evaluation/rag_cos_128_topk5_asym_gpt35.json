Let's continue this epic adventure and start off episode 5 here.  So, at the end of episode 4, we had an interesting conversation with Gale.  He told us that he needs to consume The Weave from powerful magic items or a great catastrophe would occur.  He doesn't need these items yet, but it's best to be prepared.  So that was an interesting request out of Gale.   We also killed Kagha because we found out that she was part of the Shadow Druids and the Grove is going through some restructuring now.  The Tiefling are not being kicked out anymore, but they do have to make the trip to Baldur's Gate at some point.  Zevolor asked us to take out the goblin leaders in the area if we could, to make their journey a little bit easier.
