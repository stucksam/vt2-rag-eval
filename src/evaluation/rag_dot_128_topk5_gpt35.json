Firstly, darkvision allows Wood Elves to see in darkness as if it were dim light, giving them an advantage when navigating through the forest at night or in areas with low light. This ability helps them to spot potential targets or threats more easily, enhancing their archery skills. Secondly, Fey ancestry provides Wood Elves with advantage on saving throws against being charmed and immunity to being put to sleep by magic. This resistance to magical effects helps them to remain focused and alert while hunting or hiding, making them less susceptible to distractions or enchantments that could hinder their archery or camouflage abilities. Additionally, the Wood Elf subrace's reclusive lives in Faerun's forests and their decades of training in archery and camouflage are further enhanced by an otherworldly swiftness. This swiftness, which is likely a result of their Fey ancestry, allows them to move quickly and silently through the forest, making it easier for them to find advantageous positions for archery or to blend seamlessly into their surroundings for camouflage.
